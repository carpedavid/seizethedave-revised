*Technologist, entrepreneur, game designer, and general creative person. Proud husband, and dad to three burgeoning superheroes. MBA.*

I am a transformative leader with nearly two decades of experience driving positive change through strategic planning, organizational design, process engineering, and cultural alignment. I lead, work, and mentor in the intersection of entrepreneurship and technology ‚Äî especially in high-growth organizations.

Additionally, I come from a family of talented artists and inherited a powerful creative drive. As a result, I write poetry for children and adults and short stories filled with talking cats, horrible monsters, paranormal bloggers, and unlikely bands of heroes. I also fold origami, do calligraphy, and occasionally draw, paint, and take photographs.

I currently live in Cleveland, OH with my lovely wife, three rambunctious kids, and four furry friends.

## A note about reviews

Unless otherwise noted, I have paid for any and all items that I have reviewed out of my own pocket. I will always disclose whether an item has been provided to me for review purposes. I may include links to retailers that I purchase products from, if I feel that the retailer has provided excellent service.
