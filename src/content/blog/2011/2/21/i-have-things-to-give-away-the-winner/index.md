Two weeks ago, I posted a contest to give away some Diamine ink samples. I updated the post to include the winner I'd randomly selected from the comments, but I'm not sure that it was noticed. So, the winner gets a post all her own! Connie - please email me with your contact info so that I can ship out your inks and notebook. If I don't hear from you by the end of the week, I will have to select another winner.
