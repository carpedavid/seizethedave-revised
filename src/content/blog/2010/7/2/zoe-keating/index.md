I’m enjoying [Zoe Keating](http://zoekeating.com/)’s new album “Into the Trees” about as much as is possible to enjoy something. For those unfamiliar with Ms. Keating, she is an avant-garde cellist who uses looping and sampling of her own work to create full, lush, multi-layered modern classical music.

If you like the music of Philip Glass or simply appreciate wonderful, meditative music, check her out. You can preview her new album at her website, so head on over.
