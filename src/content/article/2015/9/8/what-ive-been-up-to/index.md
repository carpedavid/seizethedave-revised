This is Maya. She's a teeny tiny bundle of snuggles and giggles, and she just turned ten months old today. As those of you who currently have, or in the past had ten-month-old kids know, they're fairly time-consuming.Â Maya joined our family when she was nine days old, the same day I started my new job, which was about six months after finishing my two-year MBA program. It's been a busy few years without much of a break or time to be creative.

I need to get back into writing and reviewing, though. I miss the creative outlet it provides me, and I've got a _gigantic_ backlog of products to review.

So, you're likely to see a little bit more activity here in the coming months. Some of the posts might be a bit more limited than you're used to from me, but it'll be a start. And we'll see how it goes from there.
