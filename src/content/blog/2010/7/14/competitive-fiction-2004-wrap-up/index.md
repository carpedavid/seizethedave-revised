Well, that’s a wrap for the competitive fiction pieces from the 2004 tournament. Next week, I’ll present the stories from the 2007 tournament that I ended up winning. I hope you’ll stick around for those.

Also, stay tuned Friday for a flash fiction story from 2007 that I also found in my archives.

Thanks to all for reading!
