Apparently I earned the distinction of being the [notebook addict of the week](http://www.notebookstories.com/2012/01/27/notebook-addict-of-the-week-david-garrett/) over at [Notebook Stories](http://www.notebookstories.com/). If you haven't checked out Nifty's blog, be sure to do so - it contains a veritable treasure trove of notebook related news, reviews, and links. Nifty is also the founder of the Carnival of Pen, Pencil, and Paper, where I've had a few ink reviews featured.
