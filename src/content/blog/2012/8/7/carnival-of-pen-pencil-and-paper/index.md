The August edition of the Carnival of Pen, Pencil, and Paper is now available over at Daisy Yellow. Be sure to go check out all of the great articles that the pen, pencil, and paper community has posted over the last month.

Also, be sure to check out the Carnival home page over at Notebook Stories.

Last, but not least, the September edition will be hosted right here at Seize the Dave! You can submit your articles for consideration over at the Blog Carnival submission form. I look forward to reading them!
