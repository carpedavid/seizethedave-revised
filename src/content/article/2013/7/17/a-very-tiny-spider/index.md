A very tiny spider pranced around atop my head.
It shimmied down my earlobe, and then dangled from a thread.
It scurried down my shoulder, and then scuttled down my arm,
While I watched with much amusement, since it clearly meant no harm.

Oh, where do spiders wander when they walk across the floor?
Do they have a spider family waiting just outside the door?
I hope its web is warm and soft when the day comes to an end.
Farewell, good bye, and bon voyage, my very tiny friend.
