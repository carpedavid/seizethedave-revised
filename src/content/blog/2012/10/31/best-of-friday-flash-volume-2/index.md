I'm happy to announce that a short story of mine, [Wasps](/blog/2010/10/22/wasps), has been published in the newly released anthology, Best of Friday Flash, Volume 2.

Flash fiction is a story that is generally shorter than 1000 words. It's a short, short story, designed to be read in a flash. The Friday Flash community produces lots of flash fiction on a weekly basis across the full spectrum of genres - most of it excellent, and all of it made available for free at the authors' websites. They are a creative and talented group of individuals, and I'm honored to have had my story selected as among their best.
