I've got quite a few things on my list to review here at Seize the Dave, including:

- TWSBI Diamond 530 Fountain Pen (my first fountain pen review)
- Ecosystem Sketchbook
- Platinum Pigmented Rose Red Ink
- Everflo Orchid Ink
- Diamine Indigo Ink
- Diamine Midnight Ink

and lots more. I'm also contemplating adding reviews of loose leaf tea - one of my other passions that seems increasingly out of place on a professional technophile. Watch for all of them in the weeks to come!
