I have finally completed the long migration of all of my content from tumblr to blogger. In the process, I've taken the opportunity to clean a few things up and to cut some posts that were links to expired contests and other things that have gone stale. I've also tried to be more consistent when labeling posts, so finding my ink reviews, poetry, short stories, and other content should be a bit easier now.

So far, I like blogger, but there are things I miss about tumblr. We'll see how this works out. Thanks for your patience while I moved things around.
