If bees built bombs and not honey,

Oh, what kind of world would it be?

Would bears lay siege to bee-bunkers,

And not spend their days climbing trees?

What of the humble bee keeper,

Would power go straight to his head?

When crossing the hive, instead of alive,

Would you suddenly find yourself dead?

I don’t think a world without honey

Is one in which I’d want to stay.

I’d rather spend time tasting clover field wine,

Than keeping bee-bombers at bay.
