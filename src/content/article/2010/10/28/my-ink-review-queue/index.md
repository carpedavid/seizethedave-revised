I didn’t have time to write an ink review this week, but I did have the opportunity to look through my ink collection to figure out what to review next. In the 8 months I’ve been writing reviews, I’ve managed to publish [24 ink reviews](/categories/ink-reviews/), but I’ve got a lot more left to go. Since there are no signs that I’m going to stop collecting ink any time soon, I suspect I’ll be writing up reviews until I’m old and grey.

For those that are curious, I’ve put together a list of the inks that I have in my collection that I haven’t reviewed yet:

- Diamine Jet Black
- Diamine Midnight
- Diamine Sepia
- Iroshizuku Shin-ryoku
- Iroshizuku Tsukushi
- J Herbin Bleu Myosotis
- J Herbin Eclat de Saphire
- J Herbin Rouge Opera
- J Herbin Terre de Feu
- Noodler’s Tiananmen
- Private Reserve Chocolate
- Private Reserve Orange Crush
- Skrip Red (Vintage)

Of course, there are a number of inks that I’m still interested in picking up. Here’s what’s on my wish list, currently:

- Diamine Pumpkin
- Everflo Orchid
- Iroshizuku Asa-gao
- Iroshizuku Yama-guri
- J Herbin Perle Noire
- Platinum Carbon

So, fellow inky people, are there any inks you’d like to see me review? Also, what inks are on your wish list right now?
