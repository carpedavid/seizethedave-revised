Good morning, pretty sleepyhead.

I miss you as you lie in bed,

While hiding from the morning light,

And trying to extend the night.

You turn and shut your weary eyes,

While, up above, the night-time skies

Transform into a golden day;

You fight to keep the world away.

So now I sit and watch the clock.

With every tick and every tock,

I count the minutes patiently,

And wait for you to come to me.
