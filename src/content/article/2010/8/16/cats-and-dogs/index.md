The cats and dogs of Shangri-la

Parade around the town,

With drums and flutes and tubas, too,

From morning â€˜till sundown.

When, late at night, they snuggle tight

And settle down to sleep,

There in their dreams they learn the tunes

And rhythms they must keep.

Then, when they wake, they gather up

The instruments they play,

And, one by one, they fall in line

To march another day.
