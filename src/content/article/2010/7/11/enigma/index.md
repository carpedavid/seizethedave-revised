The door is locked,
My egress blocked –
From here, there’s no escape.

But where is there?
The walls of air
Refuse to take a shape.

There’s only light,
No stair in sight,
As mist gives way to mist.

I’ve found no key,
No hope for me
Is certain to exist.

“Who’s there?” I cry;
Out there I spy
A figure moving round.

The man I see
Then, suddenly,
Fades out without a sound.

My voice grows hoarse
But, then, of course
No answer is in store -

This dismal curse
Grows ever worse,
Trapped here forever more.
