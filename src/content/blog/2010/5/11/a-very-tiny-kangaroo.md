A very tiny kangaroo
About three inches high
Hopped up to me one afternoon
And looked me in the eye
“Why hello Roo, how do you do?”
I asked the little guy

(He had no pouch
Which is how, you see
That I knew that the roo
Was a he and not she)

The roo and me, we drank some tea
As the afternoon rolled by
We lay in the grass and watched the clouds
As they sailed across the sky
‘Till the fireflies danced their sleepy dance
And the kangaroo waved goodbye
