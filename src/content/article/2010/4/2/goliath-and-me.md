If I had a dog named Goliath
There’s nothing that we wouldn’t do
We’d spend every day together and play
Together forever, we two

We’d climb to the top of a mountain
And swim to the floor of the sea
We’d sail away for a year and a day
Together, Goliath and me

If I had a dog named Goliath
There’s nowhere that we wouldn’t go
We’d fly to the moon in a big red balloon
And ski in the Antarctic snow

Goliath and I would be best friends
And best friends forever we’d be
As everyone knows, other friends come and go
But Goliath would always love me
