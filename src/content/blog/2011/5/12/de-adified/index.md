Ah, that's much better. I have removed ads from Seize the Dave. I originally added them to the site because I wanted to get a feel for how they worked. I don't have to work with them in my day job, but I have to work with the people who work with them - so a working knowledge helps me be conversant. I figured that if they contributed to the general ink fund, it would be a nice benefit. They haven't.

So, I have removed them for now. The place looks a lot tidier as a result. They might make an appearance in some form or another in the future, but for the moment, Seize the Dave is an advertisement free site.
