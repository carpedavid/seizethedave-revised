Happy Halloween!

To celebrate the season of ghouls and ghosts, I posted five horror stories during the month of October: four flash-fiction-length and one short story. Thanks to everyone who read along and commented on the stories - I certainly appreciated all of the encouragement and I had a lot of fun writing them.

For those that might have missed them, the five stores are:
