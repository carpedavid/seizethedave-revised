For your snowy Friday afternoon reading pleasure:

- Leigh Reyes once again [puts us all to shame](http://www.leighreyes.com/blog/?p=3112) with her artistic abilities and demonstrates a wet-on-wet technique with water and fountain pens.
- Over at Ink Nouveau, Brian Goulet lets us know about two new "fast dry" inks from Noodler's.
