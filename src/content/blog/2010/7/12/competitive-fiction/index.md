Today through Wednesday, I’ll be sharing three stories from a writing tournament that I competed in during 2004. I made it to the semifinals before being defeated, but I didn’t go down without a fight.

Each pair of competitors was given a selection of images, and the challenge was to create a cohesive story around them. Then a panel of judges critiqued and selected the winner of each pair.

I believe that each of the stories still holds up without the original prompts, so I’ve decided to share them here. Round one today, round two Tuesday, and the semi-final story on Wednesday. I hope you enjoy them.
