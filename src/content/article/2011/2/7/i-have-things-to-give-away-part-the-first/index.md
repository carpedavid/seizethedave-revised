Now that I've made it through all of the samples of Diamine ink that I was sent, I'm happy to pass some of them on (the others I will keep to provide comparisons on future reviews). Each sample is about 15ml (half a 30ml bottle). So, for a chance to win samples of Diamine Imperial Purple, Diamine Red Dragon, and Diamine Midnight, just leave a comment on this thread. You will have until Midnight EST on February 11th to enter.

Sometime during the weekend, I will use random.org to generate the winning comment number, and the winner will receive the three samples along with a large, hardback, Moleskine sketchbook. I will happily ship internationally. Good luck!

UPDATE: We have a winner! Connie - please email me with your contact info so that I can ship out your inks and notebook.
