On a winter’s day

When the air is crisp and fresh and clean and

The snow that falls ever so gently, gently, gently

Gleams in the golden light of the morn,

While the world stands quiet, quiet, quiet

Because all of the animals

Have looked at each other and whispered, “Hush,”

You turn to the person you love and

Hold them tight in your arms since

You are the only two that exist

From now until eternity,

And it is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, because

On a winter’s day

Everything is silent and perfect and still.
