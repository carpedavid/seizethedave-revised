As part of my Thanksgiving travels, I drove six hours along the PA turnpike, which gave me plenty of time to catch up on podcasts that I’d been neglecting. I want to single out Pseudopod for mention, as it’s a great podcast filled with menacing, grotesque, and creepy horror fiction.

Each episode features either three flash-length stories (1500 words or less) or one standard short story (2000-6000 words). Some are macabre, some are psychological, some are supernatural, and others are just bizarre, but they were all uniformly good.

So, if you’re in the mood for some great horror stories, be sure to check out [Pseudopod](http://pseudopod.org/).
