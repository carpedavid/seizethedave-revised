As I was driving to work this morning, the people on the radio were discussing the merits of pajama jeans, which, for the unaware, are apparently pajamas that look like jeans.

The woman on the radio team was stressing that she liked the idea because it provided better comfort. She could roll out of bed and come to work in pajama jeans.

I’d like to know when jeans became the new benchmark from which we’re measuring comfort. I have to dress up for work; jeans are what I put on when I want to be comfortable.

If we as a culture accept pajamas at work, then what’s next? Snuggies Fridays?

You know how people in old sci-fi movies and tv shows are all wearing jumpsuits? This is how we get there. Today it’s pajama jeans. Tomorrow, everyone’s wearing a onesie.
