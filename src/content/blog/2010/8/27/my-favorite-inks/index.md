My ink collection keeps growing, and the organizer I have for them currently is beyond full - it’s about to start overflowing. As I was juggling ink bottles yesterday, I began thinking - if I had to downsize my collection (as opposed to finding a bigger space to store them, which is what I’m actually going to do), what inks would I keep?

I’ve narrowed it down to five:

J. Herbin 1670 - I like red inks, and this is my absolute favorite. It’s gorgeous in every pen I own, and it is easy to read and write with.

Noodler’s Kung Te-Cheng - My current blue ink favorite. It’s the color of sapphires dipped in indigo, it dries relatively quickly, and it’s bulletproof.

J. Herbin Poussiere de Lune - This purple ink with grey tones writes nicely, and is of a character that is appropriate for business. It’s also easy to read and behaves well on most paper.

Iroshizuku Momiji - My second favorite red ink. It possesses a much lighter feel than the J. Herbin 1670.

Pelikan Blue Black - The newest ink in my collection is now one of my favorites. It’s a dryer ink, so it does wonders to tame the wet writing pens in my collection. It’s also a pretty blue with moderate shading.

If you had to pare down your ink collection to five, which ones would you save?
