At the beginning of the month, I issued a challenge to myself to produce a short story a week for each of the four weeks of March. At the time, I anticipated writing four disconnected stories that were joined by a common topic. Instead, I've stumbled into a cast of recurring characters who I really enjoy writing about.

Therefore, I'm going to issue a different challenge to myself. I'm going to turn the Sacred Geometry stories into an ongoing series starring Scarlett, the paranormal blogger. I'm setting a goal for myself to release 1000-2000 word chunks of her ongoing adventures every two weeks until the story is complete.

So, check back next Friday, April 1st, for the next installment of Sacred Geometry.
