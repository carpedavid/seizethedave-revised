I do not fear the winter time –

The drifts of snow, the freezing cold,

For every leaf must turn and fall,

And every young man must grow old.

I do not fear the winter time,

Since winter surely turns to spring,

When ice gives way to tender buds,

And robins hatch and learn to sing.

Oh, I am in my summer now,

And autumn – it will be sublime,

But surely, though the summer fades,

I do not fear the winter time.
