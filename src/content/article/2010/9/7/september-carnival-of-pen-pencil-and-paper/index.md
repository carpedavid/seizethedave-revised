The September Carnival of Pen, Pencil and Paper is now live at the [Office Supply Geek website](http://officesupplygeek.com/uncategorized/welcome-to-the-september-carnival-of-pen-pencil-and-paper/). I’ve got two articles featured - my review of Noodler’s Kung Te-Cheng ink and my review of the Quo Vadis Habana notebook.

Be sure to stop by and check out all of the great reviews and articles about pen, pencil, and paper.
