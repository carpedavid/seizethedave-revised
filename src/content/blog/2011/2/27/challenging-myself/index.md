I've been so caught up in reviewing ink lately that there has been a dearth of fiction here on Seize the Dave. Therefore, I've decided to set two challenges for myself. Each Friday in the month of March, I will post a work of speculative short fiction on the topic of Sacred Geometry. What does that mean? Good question. You'll have to tune in to find out. In April, I will post a poem a week, though I'm unsure as to what form they will take.

Wish me luck!
