This origami box was folded from 8 uncut sheets of paper: 4 double sided (lid) and 4 patterned (base). The box was assembled entirely without glue or fastener of any sort, as the four units for the base and lid all slot together to form a structurally stable unit. The completed box measures about 3 inches square.

The box pattern was created by the celebrated origami master Tomoko Fuse, and can be found in her book Origami Boxes.
